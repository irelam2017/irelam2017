hello team.   I am trying to install Htmlviewer 11.9. I am getting a critical compile error. Looking in Google I find that TObjlist cannot be found, 
but that it "could' be reverted to a simple TList definition. The actual source line is History :=  TObjlist;   When I do this reversion, I get a critical compilation 
error.
Checking on Google for the compiler error message all I get is a whole lot of entries regarding this crash. I have tried some of these 'solutions' but they all raise a Critical
compiler error.   So there seems to be a problem with collecting History entries. All I can think of doing is to disable History recording. That seems rather
heavy.  Is any one else suffering this problem ?  Any suggestions please ?

Martin
